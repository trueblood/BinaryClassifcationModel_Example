    "Short Description:\n",
    "This project uses a Perceptron model to detect falls based on incident descriptions. The text data is vectorized using TF-IDF and then classified as a fall or non-fall using the perceptron learning rule. The model can predict fall events based on incident text, offering a simple yet effective method for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perceptron Learning Rule:\n",
    "The perceptron learning rule updates the model's weights incrementally based on the error in prediction. If the perceptron makes an incorrect prediction, the weights are adjusted by adding the product of the learning rate, the input vector, and the difference between the actual and predicted output. This process continues until the model converges to a solution or reaches the maximum number of iterations."
